There are 2 ways you can go around installing this plugin, which depends on where you bought it.

## Option 1: Install from Unreal Marketplace

If you're here this early, I'm so sorry, but I need this thing to be up and public first before I can actually write (and take screenshots for) how to install this way. Though you can probably figure this out on your own.

## Option 2: Install from itch.io

itch is good

```cpp
const auto ILikeItch = Yes(uwu);
```
