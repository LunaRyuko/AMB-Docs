Hi there! Thank you for checking out my plugin!

Accumulation-Based Motion Blur is a plugin that allows you to emulate in Unreal Engine the post-process Motion Blur effect common on early 2000s games, while bringing a range of options in order to allow different desired effects.

Please note that the plugin only supports 4.26, 4.27, 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2.

Before reporting problems, please see the [Known Issues](/en/general/known-issues) page.

For support, email me at support-uemarketplace@enbywit.ch
